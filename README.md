# Background
A marketing campaign is a set of commercial operations all pursuing the same objective, which may concern the improvement of brand awareness and/or sales objectives.
Companies use direct marketing strategies when they target customer segments by contacting them to achieve a specific sales campaign. 
Direct marketing ultimately aims to establish cost-effective, two-way and one-to-one communications with individual customers, which is not restricted to the internet.

# Problem Statement and Objective
As said before, eventhough this direct marketing aims to establish cost effective however if we call all of our customer without knowing either they will place the deposit or not it's not effective at all. 
Also, this kind of marketing could also make some customer feel uncomfortable. So, it is important to make the campaign cost as low as possible and prevent from customers complaint.
According to the problem, we have to know what kind of customer that will subscribe a term of deposit and to train the best machine learning model that is able to predict whether the customers will subscribe a term of deposit or not.

# Business Question
- Does duration and campaign (amount of call) on this campaign have correlation with the customer decision to subscribe ?
- How does social dan economic context related to the customer Subscription?
- Which job type tend to open the term subscribe ?
- Does marital status relate on customer's decision to subscribe ?
- How customer's last education relate on Subscription?
- Does personal loan and housing loan feature has a relationship with the customer decision to subscribe?
- Whether cellphones or telephones should be used to improve consumer interest to subscribe ?
- Do customers tends to subscribe if the outcome on previous campagin is success?
- When is the best time to attract customers, so They decide to subscribe?

# Conclusion and Recommendation
- The best time to approach customer is March, September, and December, especially on Thursday.
- If it is possible call customer by cellular.
- The bank should approach more single customers who are thirty years old .
- The bank should explore more why students and illiterate have high proportion of subscription in job and last education feature.
